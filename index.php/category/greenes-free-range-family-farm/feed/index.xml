				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Greenes Family Farm, we are always around to take special care of our hens. Keeping their safety as a number one priority helps ensure the highest quality eggs. We get up bright and early to make sure our birds are happy and their needs are catered for. Our family walk among the flock paying close attention to them, making sure they have everything they need and are in good health. We are always on hand to open their pop holes so they can freely roam our fresh pastures.</p>
